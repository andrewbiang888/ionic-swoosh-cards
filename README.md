Ionic Contrib: Swoosh Cards
===================

This is an extension of ...

[Tinder Cards](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-ion-tinder-cards)
[Swipe Cards](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-ion-swipe-cards)
[Tinder Cards 2](https://github.com/loringdodge/ionic-ion-tinder-cards-2)

...and is reminiscent of the cards found in the National Geographic app.
No partial swiping is permitted and cards are rotated in a carousel. Cards fly away (or swoosh away)
on discard.
